# Awesome-Causal-Inference
A curated list of awesome work on causal inference and (some) causal discovery, particularly in machine learning.

I am gathering resources (currently @ 271 papers) as literature for my PhD, and thought it may come in useful for others. This list includes work relating causal inference to deep learning, statistics, machine learning, and representation learning. If I've missed your paper, or there's a paper you want on the list, then feel free to contribute or email me : ]

The are ordered by year (new to old).
